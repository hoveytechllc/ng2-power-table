# Power Table

Power Table is table module for Angular 2 that is based on a great module, [Smart Table](https://github.com/lorenzofox3/Smart-Table), for AngularJS. Since I couldn't find Smart-Table written for Angular 2 I am making my own attempt.

# Usage

Simple usage:

`ptTable` is required parent directive. Other directives/components prefixed with `pt` depend on `ptTable`. In the simple example below `ptTable` is provided the full array of customers (one-way binding into the directive). Internally the directive filters/sorts/pages the array and returns it using `ptDisplayArray` (one-way binding out of the directive).

```javascript
<table [ptTable]="allCustomers" [(ptDisplayArray)]="customers">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th ptSort="id">Id<th>
            <th ptSort="name">Name<th>
            <th>Open Invoices<th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr ngFor="#c of customers">
            <td>{{c.id}}</td>
            <td>{{c.name}}</td>
            <td>{{c.invoices}}</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

## Test

Run `npm install` then `npm run test`
